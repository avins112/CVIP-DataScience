Repository for Data Science Projects

This repository contains the files related to my internship tasks and projects. The tasks are divided into two phases, each consisting of a normal task and a golden task. Here's an overview of the tasks in this repository:

Phase 1:
Normal Task - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism
In this task, I have performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset related to terrorism. The aim was to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and factors associated with terrorism incidents. The analysis included data visualization, statistical summaries, and identifying correlations between different variables.

Golden Task - Breast Cancer Prediction
For the golden task of Phase 1, I have worked on a breast cancer prediction project. Using machine learning techniques, I built a predictive model to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of features. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
